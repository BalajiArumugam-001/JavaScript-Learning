      JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user. Common examples of JavaScript that you might use every day include the search box on Amazon, a news recap video embedded on The New York Times, or refreshing your Twitter feed.
      
Adding interactive behavior to web pages<br>
JavaScript allows users to interact with web pages. There are almost no limits to the things you can do with JavaScript on a web page â€“ these are just a few examples:
 *Show or hide more information with the click of a button<br>
 *Change the color of a button when the mouse hovers over it<br>
 *Slide through a carousel of images on the homepage<br>
 *Zooming in or zooming out on an image<br>
 *Displaying a timer or count-down on a website<br>
 *Playing audio and video in a web page<br>
 *Displaying animations<br>
 *Using a drop-down hamburger menu <br>
 
 So, In simple terms ,Javascript is used to add some interactive function on your website.<br>
